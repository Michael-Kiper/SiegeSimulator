Hello!

Welcome to this Siege Simulator - a game that tries to use deep learning to control the moves of a Special Agent trying
to ward off an onset of enemies using its environment.

Game Attributes:
    - Bottles: bottles can be found on the ground, if the Special Agent steps on it, all enemies within a certain
    hearing distance will be alerted to the area.
        - uses an A* heuristics algorithm to find the route
    - Lights: a light switch can be found and when turned off, the enemies only can see within a small radius while
    our Special Agent can still clearly see due to night vision goggles.
    - Comms: a possible attribute where the enemies can communicate with each other, so if one of the is in danger,
    the others are alerted
    - Cabinets: our Special Agent can hide in this cabinet for a certain period of time before it breaks, but cannot
    shoot from it
    - Armour: Enemies are equipped with a certain amount of armour that allows them to take more damage
    - Grenades: the Special Agent has the ability to throw a certain number of grenades that can bounce off of walls

    - Possibly:
        - create a floor plan generator and make the various parts of the house with IDs (so the agent can hide in
        certain items)
        - create it where the agent only has a certain amount of time or the enemies have to go around until they find
        the treasure

The game is won when all of the enemies are defeated

# Note:
- all wall coordinates need to have the start x and y be less than or equal to end x and y.
